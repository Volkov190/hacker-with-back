Our mission is to reduce the time and cost to create high quality code using AI. We have worked at the full gamut of companies ranging from startups to big tech and have gotten the sense that many of the rote aspects of software development could be made easier, freeing up precious mental energy.<p>Devs love CoPilot, but autocomplete is just one of many ways that AI should make programming easier. We’re taking a more comprehensive approach to developer tooling that bundles CoPilot-like autocomplete with documentation, custom AI instruction, and some early refactoring capabilities (Python only) in one extension. We currently support Javascript&#x2F;Typescript, Python, Go, and Rust, with more coming soon. Overview (w&#x2F; bg music): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=x-gKEbgyzCg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=x-gKEbgyzCg</a>.<p>In addition to autocomplete, which can be triggered either automatically or manually, we can add documentation to all your methods in a Rust file, or you can ask the AI to insert missing imports in a Python file. In some cases we can get really sophisticated and ask it to program a game from scratch or update your REST interface to accommodate a new data payload.<p>We use a combination of AI (e.g. OpenAI codex) and AST transformation &#x2F; metaprogramming techniques on the backend. We are also working on providing other backend solutions for varying needs, including on-prem deployments.<p>We soft launched our product with a small cohort of users and want to welcome more of you to our pilot beta. We hope you enjoy the product and look forward to learning from you.<p>We are currently in an extended free trial phase for early adopters and plan to keep a free tier for solo devs and open source contributors. We also offer a generous discount to startups. For enterprise please reach out to info@mutable.ai<p>We want to thank our very earliest users and invite the HN community to try the product installing it via the VS Code marketplace [1] and email us directly with feedback or feature suggestions (support@mutable.ai).<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.visualstudio.com&#x2F;items?itemName=mutable-ai.mutable-ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.visualstudio.com&#x2F;items?itemName=mutable-...</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mutable.ai&#x2F;community\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mutable.ai&#x2F;community</a>","comments_count":0,"time":1659545286,"title":"Show HN: MutableAI (YC W22) – CoPilot Alternative for VS Code","url":"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mutable-ai.mutable-ai","points":1,"type":"link","comments":{"create":[]}},{"user":"agonz253","time_ago":"15 minutes ago","content":"","comments_count":1,"time":1659545182,"title":"Netflix Is Scrambling to Learn the Ad Business It Long Disdained","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-ads-plan-streaming-business-11659538834","points":1,"type":"link","comments":{"create":[{"user":"Rackedup","time_ago":"a few seconds ago","content":"","comments_count":0,"time":1659546027,"title":"","url":"item?id=32334228","points":null,"type":"comment","comments":{"create":[]}}]}},{"user":"hedora","time_ago":"15 minutes ago","content":"","comments_count":0,"time":1659545145,"title":"A long hot summer ahead for the US CO2 market","url":"https://www.gasworld.com/a-long-hot-summer-ahead-for-the-us-co2-market/2023413.article","points":1,"type":"link","comments":{"create":[]}},{"user":"failTide","time_ago":"16 minutes ago","content":"","comments_count":4,"time":1659545043,"title":"Psychedelic drugs hurt few and could help many.

One of the ways in which I wanted to improve my trading was to have an overview of how different groups within the market perform, and ultimately double down on the strongest or weakest ones.

So I built ismarkethigh.com where I compute aggregates myself using over 4500 stocks from NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges. If you are interested you can find more detail about the aggregates in the &quot;About&quot; section of the page.<p>I already find it useful in selecting specific groups and stocks to trade in so I hope it can help others as well.

We’re Dan, Jan, and Brent from iollo (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iollo.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iollo.com&#x2F;</a>). We’re developing an at-home metabolomics test that measures hundreds of “metabolites” in blood, which studies have shown can inform about health status, disease risk, dietary patterns, and physical activity. We will then provide evidence-based dietary, behavioral, and therapeutic treatments to help extend the number of years you’re disease-free (your “healthspan”).<p>Today’s healthcare system is reactive, meaning diseases are treated only after symptoms are present. By the time they are detected, they’re often already serious issues that require irreversible interventions, like taking lifelong medications and living with their side effects. Collectively, we end up spending trillions of dollars treating diseases reactively that can often be prevented with good health monitoring and management. Also, a lot of age-related diseases develop as a result of molecular imbalances that accumulate over years.<p>One scientific field where many of these molecules can be measured is called metabolomics. Having worked in this field for more than a decade, we know that the technology exists to detect potential signs of chronic conditions at the earliest stages, when they are most actionable. Dan has a PhD and did his postdoctoral research at Stanford in computational biology and metabolomics. His work covers healthspan extension, lifespan extension and machine learning-based tools for drug repurposing. Jan, who was Dan’s PhD thesis supervisor, is a professor of computational biomedicine and metabolomics at Cornell. He has published over 90 metabolomics-related papers, with a focus on age-related chronic diseases, such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease. Brent was the co-founder of Circle Medical, a primary care provider via video and in-person.<p>The “metabolome” is defined as the complete set of small molecules found in biological organisms with a size of &lt;1,500 Dalton, also known as metabolites [1][2]. This comprises biochemical substances such as amino acids, nucleic acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and hormones, as well as external chemicals like drugs, environmental contaminants, food additives, toxins [3][4] and metabolites produced by the gut microbiome. As of 2022, over 200,000 metabolites have been identified in nature, 40,000 of which are in blood, and over 1,500,000 are expected to still be identified (what we call the dark metabolome) [5].<p>The same way that fasting glucose has a baseline, other metabolites in blood, like the ~600 that we measure, also have their own baseline and deviations from these baselines have implications for your overall health and aging [6]. Compared to genetic testing, which tells people what might happen to their health, metabolomics tells us exactly what is happening in a body right now. Recent studies have shown links between blood metabolites and the risk or presence of various systemic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and Alzheimer’s disease; see for example [7].<p>Here are a few examples of what the first generation of iollo reports will include:<p>(1) The food a person eats and what actually ends up in their blood are not always the same thing. This is related to the concept of “bioavailability”, which differs from person to person. For example, people with impaired sugar transporters in the gut will not experience the same spike of blood sugar as people with a normal receptor (side note: this is not always a good thing, since sugars that remain in the gut lead to IBD-like problems). Our technology measures various markers of food intake, for example of red meat and plant-based diets, that can show what actually ended up in your blood. This can help guide dietary recommendations and healthy lifestyles.<p>(2) Your personal rate of aging. Research has shown that there is a “biological age”, which might differ from a person’s actual, chronological age. People who are biologically older than their real age tend to develop more health-related issues and age-related problems compared to people who are biologically young. Our platform will provide the users with estimates of their biological age, as well as their personal rate of aging across repeated time points and potential recommendations to slow down this rate.<p>(3) Our technology measures so-called “polyamines”, a group of molecules that regular lab tests do not capture today. Polyamines have been shown to improve the immune system in aging individuals, and appear to have protective properties against various diseases. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that a long-term, polyamine-rich diet can increase blood levels of these molecules. Hence, polyamines provide an interesting angle of dietary interventions, and the success of this intervention can be monitored with our technology.<p>(4) We also find some interesting, unexpected metabolites in certain people. For example in one of our pilot studies, one of our participants had a high level of phthalic acid, which can be found in plastics and cosmetics and is a chemical known to disrupt hormones in the body.<p>The next generation of our technology is expected to provide additional information about mental health markers, metabolic disorders, inflammation and allergies, and many more.<p>How it works: We send you a blood collection device, the same one we use at Stanford for research studies. After an overnight fasting period, you stick this device to your arm and press a button. A vacuum forms and a lancet (virtually!) painlessly pricks the surface of the skin to  collect a small amount (~80uL) of blood over a couple of minutes. The faint feeling is similar to when you attach the new generation of glucose monitors, if you’ve ever used one. The device contains a sponge designed to stabilize the biochemical molecules in blood at room temperature. You package the device with a prepaid return label, and it gets express-shipped directly to the metabolomics lab.<p>As soon as we receive your sample, we store it at -80°C. Samples are defrosted, centrifuged to collect the desired blood extracts, and the extract is then dried under liquid nitrogen. These blood extracts that contain metabolites are then subjected to two different mass-spectrometry analysis step: first through an ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass-spectrometry (UPLC-MS&#x2F;MS), and second through a flow injection analysis tandem mass-spectrometry (FIA-MS&#x2F;MS) on the same instrument to specifically extract lipids. The measured mass-spectra from the machines are then analyzed using specialized software to obtain quantification values of all metabolites.<p>Here is a short video of our lab process: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Jm3mCfHJjX8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Jm3mCfHJjX8</a><p>The resulting data is then securely sent over to us (we’re HIPAA compliant), and we perform statistical analysis and machine learning to generate an individualized report. Depending on the number of tests you do, the same procedure is repeated after a few weeks or months. This allows the user to build their own, individualized longitudinal metabolic monitoring.<p>We will associate metabolite profiles with wearables data, diet, supplement and medication intake, and potentially health conditions based on current research, and provide recommendations based on these.<p>This process also shows the difference between us and the infamous Theranos (a common question we get!) Instead of building our own machines that might end up not working, we rely on decades of research in the mass-spectrometry field and work with established metabolomics labs to ensure the quality of our measurements. Moreover, every bit of information that we communicate to the users will be heavily backed by scientific evidence which we disclose in the delivered reports.<p>One of the more exciting things we&#x27;ll be able to do as our metabolomics database grows is to look for new signatures of age-related diseases at earlier and earlier stages. (Such analysis will only be done on de-identified data, only with consent, and only for our work towards extending healthspan.) One example of this is being able to detect early signatures of type 2 diabetes with metabolomics data, up to 12 years in advance, even when someone has a normal fasting glucose [8][9]! Once we’re able to detect these early disease signatures, it is much easier to find interventions to treat them and extend healthy lifespan, especially if they are still very early in development.<p>We are currently running an internal pilot and taking preorders: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iollo.com&#x2F;plans\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iollo.com&#x2F;plans</a>. We will be offering a beta version to users who’ve signed up in the coming months. Tests can be pre-ordered at $50, but we won’t charge the full subscription, which is around $212-$276 per test, until your first kit is shipped to you. If you decide to pre-order, we’ll additionally provide you with your entire metabolomics data so that you can run your own association experiments. Just type in the code HNLAUNCH with your pre-order so that we can send you your data. Right now we only ship in the US.<p>We believe we have a real chance to change the standard of care in health while developing more understanding of human health, physiology, and aging. We hope to expand metabolomics test access to users and patients, and give providers a new way to help treat age-related diseases. We really look forward to your questions and comments and feedback!<p>Thanks everyone! - Dan, Jan, and Brent.","comments_count":29,"time":1659542201,"title":"Launch HN: Iollo (YC S22) – At-home metabolomics test to extend healthy lifespan","url":"item?id=32333417","points":31,"type":"link","comments":{"create":[{"user":"thomasfedb","time_ago":"a minute ago","content":"<p>Do you have concerns about over-diagnosis, turning people in patients unnecessarily?

What do you do if you want to get a class and its students? What do you do if you want to get a Student and also its class?<p>For every iteration of the way you need to access the data you have to modify and extend your REST endpoint or do separate queries. Every time the frontend devs want new data related to existing data, they have to do another query or ask the backend to include it.<p>Or lets say Class has 1000 attributes. Does your REST interface return all 1000 every time? Or can the frontend specify which attributes to load? Things like computed attributes and functions that return data related to the object. GraphQL allows this.<p>In graphql doing these relationships is dead easy. You define a class and how a student is related to it. Then you could even ask a query like “give me the classes of a student. For each class give me all the students in those classes. For each of those students, give me their classes”. Without the backend having to add anything. All the backend has to do is define the relationship and permissions about how to access the data.<p>Most GraphQL libs provide helpers for avoiding n+1 queries also, so things get optimized in the above case by only making 4 queries to the DB. Obviously thats a contrived example and most nested things wont go so crazy. But it goes to show how a powerful the API can become from defining such a simple relationship.<p>As a backend dev you just have to work on transforming data, defining the relationships and checking permissions.

And the Fed basically told everyone that this is what needed to happen when they were talking about focusing on core CPI instead of just oil, and talking about holding interest rates above the natural rate for some time, along with their statements that the labor market remains historically strong.<p>I can&#x27;t quite predict when that will happen, but we&#x27;re certainly not there yet.<p>We should also see the entire rest of the real economy get stress tested, and you can easily bet that since the last time it was tested was 2008 we&#x27;ll see detonations in something else.  My bet is commercial real estate goes off first due to the combined effects of the pandemic, remote work, and the recession.<p>There&#x27;s still a lot of &quot;work&quot; left to be done to get into a recession.  The yield curve needs to invert for a sustained amount of time, unemployment should spike and I expect it hits around 8%, the Fed will realize they&#x27;ve gone too far and start slashing rates again.  We&#x27;ll be talking about bailing out rich people again.<p>Whatever you think about how bad this is, the actual recession is going to be 10 times worse, and most of the arguments about how horrible the current economic conditions are I think can be summed up as &quot;tell me you were too young to really remember how bad 2008 was without telling me&quot;.  And this time could very well be worse than 2008.  We&#x27;ve had even longer to build up problems in the economy (and we did basically fuck-all about regulating the banks last time) along with the fact that if the Republicans take the House they&#x27;ll likely be happy to ruin the economy to hang it on Biden (probably up until the Billionaire class starts to actually hurt and yells at enough of them to knock it off).<p>Right now it looks like we&#x27;re heading for a second half recovery in sentiment though and I don&#x27;t really expect any of this to unfold until next year after higher interest rates have had time to take effect.  Although towards the end of this year Wall St may start to realize that core CPI isn&#x27;t coming down even though oil levels off and that interest rates will still go up, and they&#x27;ll start to more accurately predict how much pain we&#x27;re in for.  Right now it seems like the prevailing sentiment is that the Fed has largely done their job, rates won&#x27;t go up much longer and that inflation is tamed because oil leveled off, so we just had the weakest recession possible which tamed all our inflation and its back to boom times--I am extraordinarily skeptical of that take.","comments_count":0,"time":1659545453,"title":"","url":"item?id=32334085","points":null,"type":"comment","comments":{"create":[]}},{"user":"dereg","time_ago":"3 hours ago","content":"<p>For me, the argument about the technicalities of what makes a recession bothers me much, much less than the smugness of a general group of the intelligentsia who once conveniently anointed themselves &quot;fact-checkers&quot; that are trying to handwave away the idea of a recession in spite of historical definitions that we&#x27;ve never strayed away from.<p>We really ought to resist bulls*t like this.

Imagine the mid-90s anime fansubbing scene, except everyone is a for-profit business who is able to obtain copyright over their translations of other people&#x27;s work. It was <i>incredibly</i> scummy and hostile to artists in ways that would make Jeff Bezos[0] blush.<p>There&#x27;s also a related problem of dividing &quot;official&quot; and &quot;unofficial&quot; works in such a way as to be legally airtight. &quot;Noncommercial use&quot; is actually <i>really narrow</i>, because the work itself is a commercial product and its production costs money. Think about how many fan artists have Patreon campaigns these days: sure, you don&#x27;t have to pay to view their work, but they are still running the same kind of business that the original&#x2F;official release is using. It&#x27;s the sort of thing more appropriate for the original creators to just have a blanket &quot;I don&#x27;t care about people who do X, Y, or Z&quot; policy&#x2F;license rather than peeling back the legal protections on certain creative jobs in a way that, say, the scumbags at large media conglomerates might figure out how to monetize. Or, in other words, that fanartist with a Patreon is arguably protected from corporate competition by the fact that their work is illegal but practically unprosecuted in a way you can&#x27;t put into law.<p>None of this would matter, of course, if copyright terms were limited to a short time period. All of the more onerous copyright rules I mentioned above were far more tolerable in a world where copyright on works people cared about regularly expired.

When the marginal supply is free - the only proper price is zero - anything else isn&#x27;t pure Capitalism. And so as free would mean no incentives to actually create anything, we give an even worse of a hack to deal with it, ownership.<p>You don&#x27;t want to fund the creation, funding the creation is inherently risky. Let the creators bear that risk, they know more than any central governing entity. A better way to deal with this is to discover what the intrinsic value for the product is, allow the creator to give it away, and then subsidize the creator the value they generated as it accrues month-by-month.<p>The nice thing with this system is that we can transition to it really easily. There are already many Open Source projects that exist, all we need to do is ear-mark a certain sized pot, figure out the weights of existing products, and hand it out. And as the economy gets stronger, allow the pot to grow, and eventually there might not be a thing as closed software, as open software will always be able to generate more value than closed.<p>I believe it is possible to do so through a modified Vickrey auction wherein real money is used. A Vickrey auction is one in which the winners pays the price the second place bidder placed - or as I prefer to look at it, the first loser. Vickrey auctions are great because they get the bidder to bid their true value. This gives us good data to determine what a certain product is worth. In this modified Vickrey auction the top 50%(or some other optimizing number we can work out) of bidders win, and they all pay the price of the highest non-winner.<p>So that would mean that 50% of people get access, and we&#x27;re turning away 50%. But we can do better than that, as we know from sampling, we don&#x27;t need to know everyone&#x27;s values to get a good idea of what something is worth, so we can use sortition to decide if a given user is even going to bid in the first place. So this might mean for a given product you only sample 0.01%, and then only 0.005% go without. That seems rather fair to me. Once we have a value for a product, the next year we might not even have an auction for it, and everyone would get access to it.<p>And we can do better than that, since the money is being subsidized, and presumably this would result in a more efficient society, the money collected through these auctions need not fund the subsidy. What we can instead do is have the auction results just be given to everyone who opts into the sortition process similar to the carbon price and dividend system. Anyone who uses less than the median amount would see that their time spent valuing products as a net-postive, and anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to vote doesn&#x27;t get their cut.<p>We would then use these weights to give away all grant money. This might mean that Firefox can be funded exclusively through this pot, and they would no longer be beholden to Google for default Search. It would mean the grant writing process would go away. Eventually the pot would grow so large that even private products, wanting a cut of their own, go open source. It would mean, as ads make products less valuable, that ads go away.","comments_count":0,"time":1659542632,"title":"","url":"item?id=32333517","points":null,"type":"comment","comments":{"create":[]}}]}},{"user":"mctaylor","time_ago":"2 hours ago","content":"<p>The concept only makes sense for physical objects.<p>The problem are the definitions of &quot;piracy&quot;, &quot;robbery&quot;, &quot;theft&quot;, etc.<p>There&#x27;s two ways you could reasonably define them: by the loss, or by the gain.<p>From a simple ethical&#x2F;logical viewpoint it stands to reason that if a gain can occur without a loss, that&#x27;s good for everyone - so we should define theft to have occurred only when a loss is incurred (and hence intellectual property theft wouldn&#x27;t be theft, and the very concept of IP makes no sense).<p>Unfortunately just because it&#x27;s good for everyone doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;ll obviously work out that way.

A lot of people still need to work with remote servers where installing X is not viable and you can&#x27;t access web ports.<p>- Simplicity. For simple interfaces, it&#x27;s far easier to just use the terminal with an extra Python dependency, than it is to create a regular UI that will require a graphical server, graphics libraries and such.

We have spent 15+ years in remote tech teams in unicorns, start-ups and scaleups.<p>Developers are increasingly under pressure to be more productive and ship faster. However, its difficult to improve what you cannot see or measure.<p>My role (Alex) was in operations and I was collaborating with Sales, Finance and other teams. All these teams had systems like Salesforce and SAP that helped them quantify what “good looks like”.<p>Meanwhile engineering (Jason’s background), was flying blind and spending up to two hours a day patching data together for their sprint meetings.<p>Some of the challenges that we faced in trying to solve this for ourselves were that:<p>Most of the data a developer can use for insight is fragmented and spread across multiple tools like Gitlab &#x2F; Github &#x2F; Jira &#x2F; Slack &#x2F; Calendar\nMost of the insight is organised around tasks &#x2F; projects. While this type of information is helpful to an extent, at the end of the day were people managing people\nTypical developer metrics were one-dimensional. Developers who were great collaborators always seemed to score lower on classic productivity metrics but they add true value<p>Our goal is to help developers improve the way they work, collaborate, and feel through data.<p>Software in this space has traditionally focused on monitoring developers and their performance for the benefit of their manager. We took a different approach.<p>Adadot is developer-centric meaning that we focus on empowering each developer to improve their own working patterns with data that only admins in their company would have been previously able to access. Team managers can see aggregated data only. Any individual developer can sign up and use Adadot without having to be part of a team licence.<p>More importantly, the work of a developer is not just code and its our core belief that the current definitions around productivity are limited. Burnout is a very real problem. Great collaborators and people who lift their teams up are underserved by code-focused engineering productivity tools.<p>Right as we started building Adadot Github&#x27;s SPACE <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;queue.acm.org&#x2F;detail.cfm?id=3454124\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;queue.acm.org&#x2F;detail.cfm?id=3454124</a> productivity came about scientifically validating our thinking!<p>Finally, we figured that no developer on the planet wants to manually enter data. So we found a way to collect and process data automatically through integrations.<p>For now the output is dashboards and benchmarks centered around three core data themes:<p>Work: Classic data-driven engineering metrics, like deployment speed and failure rate. Identify blockers in real time<p>Collaboration: Understanding if the work is happening in silos, if the team are helping each other (eg. with code reviews, participating in Support channel) and if messages and meetings are becoming a distraction<p>Wellbeing: Helping you to uncover unhealthy working patterns and protect yourself and your team from burnout. Is there enough Focus time for deep code work and when? Surfacing upskilling and new languages that are being used<p>What this is not: A monitoring tool that will tell you (or your manager) who in your team has been lazy.<p>Results:\nWe are seeing teams improve velocity by up to 50% within the first 30 days. 70% also maintain the rate of improvement for at least 3 months meaning that they are able to increase their productivity sustainably.<p>Individual developers are using it to improve their collaboration visibility and gain promotions to managerial positions.<p>Check out:<p>Our demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;share.vidyard.com&#x2F;watch&#x2F;XEctQFzdQpMgpnjY4giFNV\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;share.vidyard.com&#x2F;watch&#x2F;XEctQFzdQpMgpnjY4giFNV</a><p>Public Roadmap: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adadot.prodcamp.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adadot.prodcamp.com&#x2F;</a><p>Knowledge base: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adadothelp.document360.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adadothelp.document360.io&#x2F;</a><p>Our Ask:\nIf you are a developer - we would love for you to try Adadot and give us your feedback.

I like to think that I hold the standard for my code quality to a pretty high standard In in terms of readability, best practices, modularity, and the likes.<p>One of the projects I maintain now has a few people contributing to it, but the majority of the contributions are mine (~90% according to git).<p>When other people submit code for me to review, I am often distracted by the quality of the code in the pull request and find myself requesting tons of changes that have to do with the code quality itself (better variable naming, hiding implementations behind clean interfaces to reduce clutter, breaking large functions into smaller, more readable chunks, etc). This leads to me focusing less on the functionality of the code, but more on the style which wastes a lot of time.<p>This is a frustrating experience both for me, and for the person who is trying to submit code. My intent behind these requests isn&#x27;t to nitpick, but to hold others to a high standard, and mostly keep the codebase clean so that the new code is easy enough to read for a new person on the team to jump in and contribute.<p>These requested changes are often ignored or are taken as optional suggestions that the person contributing.<p>So two questions:\n  1. Am I being overly pedantic when it comes to style and readability?\n  2. And if not, how can I best communicate to my teammates and other contributors that code quality is important and that these &quot;nitpicks&quot; are important?","comments_count":3,"time":1659532303,"title":"Ask HN: How do you successfully nitpick during a code review?","url":"item?id=32331234","points":3,"type":"link","comments":{"create":[{"user":"codeapprove","time_ago":"3 hours ago","content":"<p>The key to these types of interactions is to make them impersonal.

Also, none of these are ad companies (Spotify maybe). Netflix already has a process by which they carefully fund programmes to be produced, and comparatively, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch and Tik-tok, do compete with youtube in the video and ad space, in a sense, however except for Twitch and Facebook they don&#x27;t pass revenue to creators.<p>Anyway, Google has demonstrated the model is a money-fire, even if you operate the largest ad network on the planet. Videos are increasingly expensive to vend, particularly as video quality expectations only get higher, digital rights management is a unending nightmare and moderating content like that is a non-trivial proposition too, particularly to keep advertisers happy. Vimeo has demonstrated this too, as revealed by the service charges they slap on uploaders for popular videos. For google, however, youtube is a loss leader, I guess, as it builds out their ecosystem, and also it has clear market dominance, which is easy to lose and difficult to acquire later if you want it.<p>So, in short, consider what the purpose of a tube site today is:\n1) Eyeballs on ads, and,\n2) A community, to facilitate point 1.\nIt&#x27;s clear why companies don&#x27;t rush to this.<p>I would say that maybe the only outstanding opportunity is some substack-like setup where people directly pay for user-made content and hosting costs are embedded in there? Google is starting to tap this market as well, with channel memberships, early video access and rewards, and also through superchats in livestreams, so maybe there&#x27;s not even an opportunity there.<p>-edit-\nIn fact, thinking it over, Microsoft did actually throw their hat in the game with Mixer, which was an expensive failure. This is actually a great example of the difficulty in moving into a dominated market. Unless you can burn money for years (mixer) to maybe make it, or outclass the competition technologically and find a new paradigm (twitch, tik-tok), it&#x27;s very hard to get in there. Look at how hard Epic Games have been trying to unseat Steam as a dominant sales platform; it&#x27;s been years and they have spent truckloads of cash on game studios and giveaways and they&#x27;re still not an equal player.\nMixer agreed to transfer their content to Facebook&#x27;s streaming service in the end.","comments_count":0,"time":1659531689,"title":"","url":"item?id=32331121","points":null,"type":"comment","comments":{"create":[]}},{"user":"PaulHoule","time_ago":"4 hours ago","content":"<p>The trouble with Microsoft’s search was that it never had an effective monetiszation engine, ads on Bing pay pennies on Google’s dollars.<p>Building a YouTube clone would be expensive for Microsoft and they probably don’t believe they can make money at it.<p>So far as competition the real competition could be for advertisers which would probably make things worse for creators.","comments_count":1,"time":1659531466,"title":"","url":"item?id=32331082","points":null,"type":"comment","comments":{"create":[{"user":"superchroma","time_ago":"4 hours ago","content":"<p>Microsoft actually experimented with the video streaming model with Mixer, I completely forgot about it.","comments_count":0,"time":1659532490,"title":"","url":"item?id=32331264","points":null,"type":"comment","comments":{"create":[]}}]}},{"user":"lajosbacs","time_ago":"4 hours ago","content":"<p>Spotify will be the first one to do this","comments_count":0,"time":1659532121,"title":"","url":"item?id=32331201","points":null,"type":"comment","comments":{"create":[]}},{"user":"matt321","time_ago":"4 hours ago","content":"<p>Last I read YouTube is not profitable","comments_count":1,"time":1659530563,"title":"","url":"item?id=32330918","points":null,"type":"comment","comments":{"create":[{"user":"zaphar","time_ago":"4 hours ago","content":"<p>It has been a while since I was at Google so the story could have changed I suppose but Youtube was quite profitable when I was there about a decade ago.

A PinePhone is $150 + a whole lot of shipping and import taxes, but many alternatives are:<p>- more expensive - the SHIFT6mq is 600 EUR, the Librem 5 starts (!) from EUR 1600 (!!!), the Fairphone 4 starts at 580 EUR. No way in fucking hell is anyone going to be buying these unless they are already in a well-paying tech job - which is automatically exclusionary towards all tech-curious teenagers worldwide, and working adults from lower-paid countries. Do we seriously want open(-ish) tech to be a toy only for the rich? I sure as hell don&#x27;t.<p>- unreliable in production - open hardware is often (more often than not?) a limited-edition item. If you are there to order from the initial batch (or if you&#x27;re lucky, the second batch), great - you can buy it. But discover it a few months&#x2F;years too late, and the product is so unobtainable from the secondary market that it might as well have never existed.<p>- difficult to purchase across territories - USA-based (or alternatively, European-based) hackers get to enjoy having an open product, whereas the rest of the world merely gets to lick the shopfront window from across the ocean.<p>- less hackable - Can you flash an open firmware on any given Android phone? Anyone&#x27;s guess. Can you do so for any random Pine product? Most likely, yes, even if it contains blobs. User freedom-wise, blobby but otherwise unrestricted firmware is heck of a lot better than any restricted firmware.<p>- not brand-new - hardware ages both in terms of specs (less powerful than the mainstream non-open alternatives - this is IMO part of what killed OpenMoko so badly), and in terms of actual hardware PCBs, batteries, screens etc aging slowly until it can no longer reliably operate&#x2F;operate within spec.<p>I will be the first to criticise the fact that Pine seems to be increasingly leaning on the community to produce working software&#x2F;firmware for their products, but I will also be the first to commend them for their ability to deliver open(-ish) hardware to more than just the globally well-off with cash to burn on their ideals (something that not all of us can do).","comments_count":3,"time":1659532906,"title":"","url":"item?id=32331343","points":null,"type":"comment","comments":{"create":[{"user":"cunidev","time_ago":"3 hours ago","content":"<p>The points above are indeed valid, but for example there is a line to be drawn between PinePhones and their secondary products.<p>Also, near the end it does explain&#x2F;justify the need for a compromise in &quot;libreness&quot;, as essentially anyone would agree on given the extraordinary price of &quot;pure libre&quot; hardware.<p>The main point in my opinion is not pushing for radical hardware, but rather accommodating the needs of developers and end users in a &quot;libre-ish&quot; lineup.","comments_count":0,"time":1659535578,"title":"","url":"item?id=32331838","points":null,"type":"comment","comments":{"create":[]}},{"user":"MartijnBraam","time_ago":"3 hours ago","content":"<p>The alternative is just using one of the discarded phones most people already have in their drawer somewhere with postmarketOS.

This means changing clouds or deploying the same infrastructure in multiple clouds requires rewriting the same thing multiple times. And even though most core resources have the same functionality, developers need to learn a new provider and all its nuances when choosing a new cloud. This is why we built Multy.<p>Multy is currently available as a Terraform provider. You can write cloud-agnostic code and then just choose which cloud you want to deploy to. Multy will then call the cloud provider APIs on your behalf. For example, the following Terraform code deploys a virtual network in AWS and can be easily changed to deploy to Azure or GCP:<p>resource &quot;multy_virtual_network&quot; &quot;vn&quot; {<p><pre><code>  cloud      = &quot;aws&quot; &#x2F;&#x2F; or azure, or gcp\n\n  name       = &quot;multy_vn&quot;\n  cidr_block = &quot;10.0.0.0&#x2F;16&quot;\n  location   = &quot;eu_west_1&quot;</code></pre>\n}<p>Our goal is to expose any configuration that is common across all clouds, but there’s always specific features that are not available in all of them. For example, if you want a very specific AWS CPU for your Virtual Machine or use a region that is only available in GCP. To enable this, we implemented overrides [2] - a way to configure the underlying infrastructure for cloud-specific purposes. You can also mix other Terraform code that uses the cloud-specific providers with Multy. While this makes you somewhat locked in, having your 80% or 90% of your infrastructure  cloud-agnostic is still very powerful.<p>You can see more complex examples in our documentation - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.multy.dev&#x2F;examples&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.multy.dev&#x2F;examples&#x2F;</a>.<p>We’re still in early days and looking for feedback from other developers on our approach.

Consolidating sustainable products on one marketplace and enabling price competition on the marketplace will make it less sucky, just like Amazon did. We&#x27;re doing this because we discovered that there&#x27;s a big chunk of sustainable buyers and brands who don&#x27;t want to buy from or work with them because they don&#x27;t trust them with ethics and sustainability.

We talked to people who wanted software that would improve their work process and we brainstormed with them how we could build software to address their needs. They sometimes asked for things they didn&#x27;t need or didn&#x27;t make sense, but we talked it out with them until we found the sweet spot between what they need and what we can realistically deliver.<p>The past few years, companies I worked for had a &quot;business analyst&quot; or &quot;business developer&quot;, a role that never existed in the early years of my career. My experience is that the function of a BA is to be a moat between the business needs and the developer. They give me specs with zero context or explanation which makes it impossible for me to engineer a solution.<p>For example, the BA tells me that users with a &quot;KE Number&quot; can&#x27;t order an inspection, and that this is a bug. I look at the code and work out from a sprawl of nested if-statements that currently the only users who can order an inspection are those who are currently up to date on their payments. I ask the BA what &quot;KE Number&quot; is and why they can order an inspection even if they aren&#x27;t up to date on their payments. He looks at me like I&#x27;m stupid and repeats the command louder and slower. I try and try to convince him that I need to know why, even though it&#x27;s incomprehensible to him that I would want to know. I finally manage to tease out that users on the Full Comprehensive plan are trusted to pay their bills and so they have permission to do anything that a user who is up to date on payments can do. Users on the Full Comprehensive plan get a KE Number, so that&#x27;s a way we can identify them.<p>Aha, now I have the actual business rule! I can find the one place this business rule is expressed, or if it isn&#x27;t there already, then I can add it. What I find instead is KENumber in various nested if-statements sprinkled all over the place from the persistence layer to the view logic. I do a git blame and find the developers who wrote these. I talk to them and find out they have no idea what KENumber is, but the BA told them &quot;If KENumber is x, then do y&quot; and so they added an if statement somewhere. I look through the Pull Request history and find 14 bug fixes in the form of &quot;User with KE Number can&#x27;t do x&quot; and every single one was solved by adding yet another if statement to check if a user has a KENumber.<p>This has been my average workday at the last three companies I worked at. I feel like everyone is annoyed with me because I waste time asking weird irrelevant questions and they don&#x27;t understand why it takes me so long to fix a bug. I thought it was a problem with the company but now I&#x27;ve switched twice and getting the same experience, so either I&#x27;ve changed or the industry has changed.<p>When I tell the higher-ups I want to be more informed of the business domain, they always respond &quot;Oh, you want to switch careers? You want to give up software engineering and become a business analyst instead?&quot; I can&#x27;t seem to get across that I need to know the business domain in order to do the job of software engineering.<p>Does anyone relate to this? Am I way off base? Is there a way to convince higher-ups that we need to know the business domain?

I am a big fan, but IMO python async code is just different from other async langauges. I used async extensively in python and compared to other languages it is a pain to use because unless 100% of the the libs you want support it you will get stuck on some sync library. Async in python is not even a 2nd class citizen. Its more like a 3rd class citizen. Its gets better every year but it is minuscule compared to regular sync code, so very few tutorials mention it and nobody teaches it as the default way of doing things.<p>In order for async to be popular it needs to be the default way of writing python. Right now its an after thought for writing “high performance” python. For example asyncio version of redis got 72,114 downloads this month. The sync version got 26,825,663. Thats not even in the same universe.<p>Historically, using something like gevent is a more drop-in solution for python if you want lightweight threads, but it comes with its own problems. Gevent gives python what Zig has that automatically turns all sync IO calls to async and your app is now magically using greenthreads.<p>However I think gevent in the past was the crutch that prevented a lot of lib authors from writing async libs.","comments_count":2,"time":1659538536,"title":"","url":"item?id=32332610","points":null,"type":"comment","comments":{"create":[{"user":"collinmanderson","time_ago":"an hour ago","content":"<p>Yes, though I do think the python async ecosystem is gradually moving from a &quot;3rd class citizen&quot; to a &quot;2nd class citizen&quot;.

I&#x27;ve been working in industry for nearly 40 years. Let me address some of your points.<p>1. Many, many jobs don&#x27;t have an actual contract listing your hours or any sort of vacation policy. Even for the jobs that do, there&#x27;s no guarantee you&#x27;ll actually be able to take your vacation, or take it when you&#x27;d like.<p>2. See (1). Vacations are almost always worked around projects. I grew up in an engineering environment and I can tell you that&#x27;s just life in an engineering environment.<p>3. Many universities offer student health plans. And check your calendar - the year is 2022. Pensions don&#x27;t exist anywhere - at least not for new employees.<p>4. I&#x27;ve experienced that working for a start-up too. It happens.<p>5. My son hasn&#x27;t had a problem finding work over the summer - that&#x27;s the bulk of his income. Yes, he also has to continue his research. But, working 60-80 hours per week for 3 months per year is pretty much normal at many places. Whether that should be the case or not is another issue, but I don&#x27;t see the Ph.D. student getting hit particularly harder than anyone else.<p>6. The trick is to align your jobs with your research. My son hasn&#x27;t had problems in that regard. Also, CS departments like to forge and maintain contacts in private industry. So there&#x27;s research alignment and department alignment to think about.<p>7. Pursuing your own research that&#x27;s not aligned with your department isn&#x27;t smart. After all, you <i>chose</i> that department - weren&#x27;t you into what they were researching? Hadn&#x27;t you talked about what kinds of things you were interested in before they brought you on? This is a two-way street - there&#x27;s things they&#x27;re looking to get from you and there&#x27;s things you&#x27;re looking to get from them. Also, no person is an island - you&#x27;re going to need help. No one is likely to help you if you&#x27;re viewed as a maverick who isn&#x27;t aligned with the department goals.<p>You are correct that the wages are barely livable. I can tell you from the experience my daughter had in pursuing a Ph.D. that the stipends for CS students are considerably higher than the stipends available for other fields in science. Plus the CS students have the opportunity to work over the Summer and make the &quot;big bucks.&quot; Altogether you should be making $60K-$70K per year, which isn&#x27;t a lot as far as CS grads go, but it&#x27;s considerably better than subsistence living. That&#x27;s the equivalent of making $30-$45 per hour which is a wage most Americans would find damn good, and can only dream about earning that kind of money.<p>All told, there&#x27;s a lot you have to go through to get a Ph.D. and lots of it is politicking. That&#x27;s why smart people hire Ph.D. grads - they know they&#x27;re people who can work against the long odds and still come out successful. That&#x27;s a desirable trait to have in the people you hire.<p>So yes, you can easily make double the money you&#x27;re currently making, but you&#x27;re never going to have the opportunity to research as you do now.
