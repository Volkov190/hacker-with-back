The public can pass initiatives or constitutional amendments without government intervention through public votes, and the few Swiss people I know consider this to be the primary political system in Switzerland (not the representative electoral system they have, though they also have a very interesting mechanism for their President which requires cross-party agreement for any government decision).<p>Saying &quot;no system fully implements direct democracy&quot; feels like a no-true-scotsman stance, since by the same token no system fully implements representative democracy either (AFAIK no country guarantees that there is a precise percentage match of party representation to the popular vote with no lower bound on how many votes a party needs to enter, as it would be unworkable to have such a system).<p>&gt; The problem is “the people” don’t have a single coherent group consciousness capable of reconciling competing priorities. That’s what leaders are for.<p>The flip side is that in representative democracies (especially with broken voting systems that are not even remotely representative such as in the US, UK, and most of the world) you are very limited in your choices of leader and thus sentiments which are popular with the public can be completely ignored. There is no mechanism to force a public initiative that has legal weight, so you have to hope that a major party will be in favour of your pet issue <i>and</i> they can convince other bureaucrats to support something that is popular.<p>I would not say that I&#x27;m a proponent of direct democracy but I don&#x27;t think having some public initiative system would be a bad thing. But if we are going to keep representative democracies with the argument that the leaders represent the people but have some expertise (though cynical people would argue that is not the case anyway) then you cannot have broken electoral systems because their political power is no longer morally justified. But of course, no party that gets in power would likely ever change the entire electoral system since they have a strong political incentive to not do so (and with representative democracies, election promises aren&#x27;t worth the paper they&#x27;re written on).","time":1660025112,"comments":{"create":[]}}]}},{"user":"mwilliaams","content":"<p>True but that works better when the lynchees get to vote with the same ease as the lynchers.","time":1660022882,"comments":{"create":[{"user":"washbrain","content":"<p>Even if they can vote equally, there&#x27;s no guarantee that minority populations will have the numbers to protect themselves from the tyranny of the majority.<p>We haven&#x27;t even gotten to the &quot;equal access to voting&quot; part here in the States yet, so we have a long long road before we get to the &quot;voting is a good tool for minorities to protect themselves&quot; phase.","time":1660024710,"comments":{"create":[]}}]}}]}}]}},{"user":"tzs","content":"<p>It can also go the other way, with a jury convicting someone even though they don&#x27;t believe the person is guilty.<p>Some say this would not be a problem because unlike in an acquittal the judge can overturn a guilt verdict.

I’d certainly listen if a friend outside of work said they think I’d benefit from more time working in an office. But I’m definitely not interested in that insight from business leaders, hypocritical authors, or randos on the Internet.<p>In short: you want to work in an office?

I haven&#x27;t been fully successful at either approach yet myself, but I have made <i>some</i> progress, at least, so I can share some thoughts.<p>First, if they have &quot;brought&quot; you in and now expect you <i>alone</i> to fix things <i>while</i> they continue business as usual, that&#x27;s a setup for failure all around. They need to &quot;buy in&quot; as much as you have, and everyone needs to establish some guidelines and expectations ahead of time.<p>Presumably, they have already bought in to the notion that things need to improve if you&#x27;ve been tasked with this at all, which is good (I don&#x27;t always have this benefit). But it&#x27;s not enough to bring somebody like yourself in, and then just continue business as usual.<p>So, first order of business - try to find a couple areas of the app that is a good combination of (1) relatively self-contained, (2) less of a moving target, and (3) able to provide visible gains when improved.<p>You might not be able to hit all 3 points, but find a good balance that gives a good bang for the buck.<p>For example, if one of your problems is data acquisition is too tightly coupled with view code, that might be a huge problem spread all over the place. So, find a subset of the problem -- something that gets used frequently (maybe, user login status? user permissions?) but is changed less frequently relative to other things.<p>Once you have a few suggestions, work with the team to agree upon ONE area. Take a little time to plan out how you want to improve it and why, and then propose your solution to the rest of the team.<p>With that done, get everyone to agree -- this one piece shouldn&#x27;t be changed during your first &quot;sprint&quot; on this item without your involvement in guiding its direction.<p>I would suggest regularly updating the team on your progress and letting them in on any decisions you make along the way. The more they can be involved and help, the better.<p>The end goal is to end up with something that everyone has a little bit of ownership in, AND something with <i>visible</i> improvements such that the rest of the team will <i>want</i> to continue working with it &quot;the right way&quot; rather than piling on top &quot;the old way&quot;.<p>Once done, try to find another feature and work it out the same way.

I thought it would be fun to discuss how people have used vacation modes so far.<p>In my case my big spring vacation is an annual cruise with an interesting group of people. I use the vacation as an excuse to go fully into &quot;Airplane Mode&quot; for a week and use my phone mostly as a camera and calendar with no internet or cell access. There are only just a few apps that I need while on the cruise ship, including the ship&#x27;s own app, and an app unique to our group.<p>It was neat being able to setup a page on the home screen just for that vacation, with the apps unique to it, and set that home page as the only home page to be shown while in that focus mode. It was pretty neat having an entire week where the home screen only showed just a couple apps.<p>I think most of my complaints about that ability are from just that it is still a page in the normal non-Focus Mode default view of the home screen. I don&#x27;t need this page in normal life and would like to hide when not in that Vacation focus. Having to scroll through it now is mostly benign though, especially when I remember to use pull-down Search instead of swiping through all the pages to get to the App Library. Also, you currently still can&#x27;t have the same app shortcuts or widgets on more than one page at a time. In this case that was mostly fine because the cruise-specific apps I don&#x27;t need any other time and I had just enough calendar apps that I could put an extra calendar widget on that page that didn&#x27;t clash&#x2F;replace&#x2F;move the calendar widget I prefer on my &quot;main&quot; (first) page, and while I wanted a Camera app shortcut, I also realize that there are gestures for it including the lock screen shortcut and it wasn&#x27;t a huge loss not to have that convenience of also having it on my Vacation focus mode page. I could imagine focus scenarios where that is much more inconvenient.<p>Those issues aside, it was rather pleasurable to reduce my phone state to such a tight couple of apps home screen for a very relaxed week.","time":1659995454,"comments":{"create":[]}}]}},{"user":"sneak","time":1659994059,"title":"Tornado Cash co-founder reports being kicked off GitHub","url":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/tornado-cash-co-founder-reports-being-kicked-off-github-as-industry-reacts-to-sanctions","points":6,"comments":{"create":[]}},{"user":"trifit","time":1659994039,"title":"Coaches Poll top reactions: Notre Dame, Texas A&M","url":"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/coaches-poll-top-25-reactions-notre-dame-texas-a-m-overrated-in-first-rankings-ahead-of-2022-season/","points":1,"comments":{"create":[]}},{"user":"gnicholas","time":1659993838,"title":"Amazon ‘drop-shipping’ resellers cost a family candy maker millions","url":"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-08-08/amazon-dropshipping-resellers-work-a-lollipop-hustle-that-cost-this-family-candy-maker-millions","points":4,"comments":{"create":[{"user":"lesuorac","content":"<p>I think the title is misleading when in context of the article.

By charging off peak you are generating more revenue for the grid, while not making it more expensive to build or maintain.

Maybe more in the winter, but if you charge on a 3.8kW charger (240V&#x2F;16A), that&#x27;s only 2-3 hours of charging at home.  You can charge on less if you want, or even on 120V and be fine most of the year, but winter will be a problem in some areas - you&#x27;re using more power for heat, and the car has to warm the pack to charge in the cold, so 120V may not deliver enough power to both warm the pack and charge the pack.

Yes.  And this is why I&#x27;m a fan of PHEVs (40-50 mile battery range, gas engine for longer travel) for the next decade or so of vehicles, because you can put a given number of cells into a lot more cars that way (you can build about 5 Chevy Volt packs for the cells going into a single long range BEV), and that offsets far more gas use, while also being less annoying to use - if you can&#x27;t always charge, it&#x27;s no problem, you just have a hybrid.<p>In terms of additional power needed, because EVs are so much more efficient than ICEs (about 85% wall-to-wheels vs 25-30% on an ICE), you only end up needing about 25% more annual power production.  There are some peak demand concerns here, but they&#x27;re fairly easy to mitigate as they approach - peak demand increases from population growth anyway, so it&#x27;s a &quot;Build out peak capacity slightly faster than you were planning to&quot; concern for power companies, not an overnight panic sort of problem.<p>And while you&#x27;re at it, EV charging after the morning commute can take up a lot of the mid-day solar surplus.<p>0: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sevarg.net&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;27&#x2F;slow-dumb-charging-quit-charging-for-ev&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sevarg.net&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;27&#x2F;slow-dumb-charging-quit-ch...</a>","time":1659995078,"comments":{"create":[]}},{"user":"tamaharbor","content":"<p>The electrical system will need to double in capacity to support 90% electric vehicles.","time":1659993662,"comments":{"create":[{"user":"sitkack","content":"<p>Not true at all.

Well, I mean it depends on what you are doing. For graduate oral exams it might be a good way to prepare.<p>But if you want to get dexterity in some field, i.e. being able to actual solve problems, I think it would not work so well. I think there is a difference in how the brain stores and recalls information in this case. If you learn a definition by heart or learn a proof technique by heart, you would be able to recall it perfectly when asked directly for it. However, I suspect that when you would be actually solving a problem and you would need to recall this information your brain would not be able to make the connection.<p>That is why in mathematics one is usually required to solve a lot of problems and why studying the theory by heart does not help much. When you do a lot of textbook problems you brain starts making connections between the chucks of proof techniques and the chunks of definitions and the chunks of whatever features your textbook problems have. Those connections are the most important part of learning mathematics and you would not get them by simply learning facts.<p>Basically, to say it in another way, you would learn the theory, but you would not learn the problem solving associated with this theory.<p>Source: I studied mathematics, the wrong way for many years.<p>EDIT: The most bitter experience I had studying mathematics. It was the first year of my graduate studies and I took an undergrad class in Graph Theory as my introduction to discrete mathematics. Since I was now a graduate student I decided to approach the class in the graduate student way. That means I focused really hard on learning the theory and learned all the proofs and all the proof techniques that we went through. And that was very fun because the proofs in Graph Theory tend to be very elegant. And I fell in love with the field. And then came the exam and I was feeling really good about all of this, because for maybe the first time in my life I had learned 105% of the theory required for the exam. That was the worst grade I got in my whole mathematics studying career. The problems on the exam were much simpler than any example or theorem encountered during class, but I just could not make the connections between the proof techniques that I had memorized and what I was looking at on my exam paper.\nI retook the exam three years later (it had no influence on my grade at this point), with very little preparation, but the preparation was 100% in solving exam type problems. I could maybe recall 60% of the theory and proof techniques.

I was on the side, I suppose, of freedom. It’s where I try to be. With me at that debate was a man called Daniel Weitzner who now works in the White House making Internet policy for the Obama administration.<p>On the other side was the then Deputy Attorney General of the United States and a lawyer in private practice named Stewart Baker who had been chief council to the National Security Agency, our listeners, and who was then in private life helping businesses to deal with the listeners. He then became, later on, the deputy for policy planning in the Department of Homeland Security in the United States and has much to do with what happened in our network after 2001.<p>At any rate, the four of us spent two pleasant hours debating the right to encrypt and at the end there was a little dinner party at the Harvard faculty club, and at the end, after all the food had been taken away and just the port and the walnuts were left on the table, Stuart said, “All right, among us now that we are all in private, just us girls, I’ll let our hair down.”<p>He didn’t have much hair even then, but he let it down.<p>“We are not going to prosecute your client, Mr. Zimmermann,&quot; he said. “Public key encryption will become available. We fought a long, losing battle against it, but it was just a delaying tactic.” And then he looked around the room and he said, ”But nobody cares about anonymity, do they?&quot;<p>And a cold chill went up my spine and I thought, all right, Stuart, and now I know you’re going to spend the next twenty years trying to eliminate anonymity in human society and I am going to try to stop you and we’ll see how it goes.<p>And it’s going badly.

Drummond’s letter of resignation sent from New Orleans in early April 1857. That letter “recited nearly every accusation of Mormon disloyalty and perfidy that had accumulated during the prior ten years” and portrayed Utah as a “territory out of control,” with Governor Brigham Young as “the prime offender” (116).\nMacKinnon shows that the real catalyst for sending troops to Utah was “the substance and rhetoric in at least three other batches of material received in Washington during the third week of March 1857, weeks before the government was aware of Drummond’s resignation” (100).<p>The first decisive documents were the Utah legislature’s two memorials urging the appointment of only Mormons to territorial offices. As Utah delegate John M. Bernhisel reported to Young, they were seen as “a declaration of war,” breathing “a defiant spirit” and “not respectful” (106). The second document was a letter sent by Drummond probably before he left California for New Orleans and unrelated to his later letter of resignation. It detailed the impossibility of enforcing federal laws in Utah. Two more letters arrived the same week from Utah Judge John F.\nKinney to Attorney General Jeremiah S. Black. Kinney gave more examples of the subversion of U.S. law in Utah and recommended that Buchanan replace Young as governor and establish an army garrison in the territory. The second Kinney letter enclosed a message from Utah’s Surveyor General David H. Burr, which included his dramatic assessment that any new governor risked assassination; Burr, too, recommended a military force.","time":1659989040,"comments":{"create":[]}},{"user":"potta_coffee","content":"<p>This is a Mormon-biased spin on the history.","time":1659985900,"comments":{"create":[{"user":null,"content":"[deleted]","time":1659986274,"comments":{"create":[]}},{"user":"kolanos","content":"<p>This was left out of the story:<p>&gt; At the height of the tensions, on September 11, 1857, at least 120 California-bound settlers from Arkansas, Missouri and other states, including unarmed men, women and children, were killed in remote southwestern Utah by a group of local Mormon militia. They first claimed that the migrants were killed by Natives but it was proven otherwise. This event was later called the Mountain Meadows Massacre and the motives behind the incident remain unclear.<p>&gt; The Aiken massacre took place the following month. In October 1857, Mormons arrested six Californians traveling through Utah and charged them with being spies for the U.S. Army. They were released but were later murdered and robbed of their stock and $25,000.<p>&gt; Other incidents of violence have also been linked to the Utah War, including a Native American attack on the Mormon mission of Fort Lemhi in eastern Oregon Territory, modern-day Idaho. They killed two Mormons and wounded several others. The historian Brigham Madsen notes, &quot;[T]he responsibility for the [Fort Limhi raid] lay mainly with the Bannock.&quot; David Bigler concludes that the raid was probably caused by members of the Utah Expedition who were trying to replenish their stores of livestock that had been stolen by Mormon raiders.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Utah_War#Overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Utah_War#Overview</a>","time":1659987129,"comments":{"create":[{"user":"russellbeattie","content":"<p>I just finished Mark Twain’s “Roughing It”.

Of course, I am imperfect, and I found that I would sometimes start training without committing my changes. An easy fix- save the output of git diff too. Eventually everything else got packratted too- package versions, which computer we&#x27;re running on, which virtual environment, command line args, etc. For the last couple years, whenever I found myself saying &quot;Dang, I could reproduce this result if only I knew X&quot;, I threw X into footsteps.<p>The final piece of the puzzle is naming the folder where we shove all this stuff, along with the weights &#x2F; figures &#x2F; etc. Timestamp is cryptic, choosing which hyperaprameter is important enough to go in the name is GAI- the only answer is to ask the user to name their experiment. Much like git messages, this seems like a burden- the only real burden footsteps imposes, I&#x27;d argue- but it&#x27;s worth it for finding the experiment you&#x27;re looking for.

What most people know about Robinhood is that it offers free trades.

The only hint in your pitch is toward the end:<p>&gt; <i>Our goal is to make it as easy as possible to “deposit” your exercise each time you get active and watch your fitness compound over time.</i><p>OK, now I can maybe see why you brought up Robinhood, although I don&#x27;t think of Robinhood as a place where people watch things compound. Mostly they just ride the day-trading rollercoaster.<p>But set that aside: what does it mean to deposit exercise? How can it compound over time? Isn&#x27;t the whole point of exercising regularly that the effects fade?<p>I think you might have something here, but you probably need to market more the way Noom does.

I&#x27;ll try to explain why I used the Robinhood analogy:<p>(1) What I feel is missing in the exercise app landscape is a product that is highly-usable to people and spans all types of activity. So my objective is to let people check in with only two clicks regardless of whether they lifted, did a yoga class, went for a walk, or played in a softball game, and ultimately to compile all of that information into a single chart which represents your exercise life. I was really inspired by the simplicity of the Robinhood and Cash App UIs and always wanted to get that &quot;single chart&quot; to work for exercise (it&#x27;s still very much in the works as I&#x27;ll mention in #4 below).<p>(2) There is a lot of high-risk activity on Robinhood, but those use-cases don&#x27;t negate the fact that it also allows anyone to make recurring deposits into a wide range of asset classes. Maybe we can think of a highly-leveraged trade like someone maxing out their back squat on their first day in the gym and severely injuring themselves. A recurring deposit into an ETF would be more like making sure you do a light jog every day. There will always be various use cases when you make a generic product.<p>(3) You absolutely fade&#x2F;atrophy when you don&#x27;t exercise regularly (in fact, you do so frighteningly quickly)... but the benefits of regular exercise also do compound over time when you are consistent. I don&#x27;t think we need to dive into whether that compounding maps directly to the S&amp;Ps average annual return or not to agree that if you are able to get yourself to do some push ups every day for 50 days straight, you&#x27;ll be in a lot better shape than you were to begin with :)<p>(4) Regarding the science-based approach.

A chart would make sense if the data is hours, heart rate, etc., but it&#x27;s not really possible to know things like how many calories the person burned. Someone playing third base in softball is going to burn far fewer calories than, say, the pitcher.<p>If the chart is just hours, then there are an endless number of apps that help you log exercise, including differentiating based no time and intensity.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this is doomed to fail because of competition, but I think the competition is going to make it hard to break through the noise that consumers hear all the time.<p>&gt; <i>Maybe we can think of a highly-leveraged trade like someone maxing out their back squat on their first day in the gym and severely injuring themselves.</i><p>I genuinely get what you&#x27;re saying, but I majored in finance, worked in finance, and have founded fintechs.

There&#x27;s a reason WallStreetBets always had screenshots from Robinhood: it was catering specifically to risk-agnostic amateur investors, and it encouraged them to do risky and stupid things.<p>That&#x27;s not a model for an exercise app. I think you should just drop the Robinhood&#x2F;finance comparison entirely, because it&#x27;s going to confuse people.

I can&#x27;t do the same for an AK because I don&#x27;t have a spot welder to attach the rails.<p>Worse than that: AK receivers have to be stamped, rails welded on, then <i>heat treated.</i> A soft AK receiver will run for a while but eventually waller out all the pin holes. The gun will get more and more rattly until it can&#x27;t completely chamber a round, at which point it will blow up.<p>The heyday of the stamped sheet metal gun was, of course, WW2. The Sten, MP 36, M3, and postwar AKM, CETME, G3, etc etc. The central planners were staring down the barrel of total war. They were thinking they would have to arm every single man, woman and child in the country. The Brits made four <i>million</i> Stens, at about $150 each.<p>For that, you want as few machining operations as possible, but you can spend on the tools themselves, since they&#x27;ll be amortized over huge production runs. Therefore you see heavy industrial processes with specialized tools: 100 ton presses stamping out 20 receivers at a time, specialized heat treat ovens to make up for the downsides of metal stamping, complex assembly jigs, etc.<p>The AR pattern rifle is unattractive for super-mass production. Milled receivers with curved surfaces and finicky blind holes. But it&#x27;s not a stressed component, so you can make the damn thing out of plastic if you want, and none of the dimensions are safety critical, since the barrel is self headspaced with bolt lugs built in. (The US could put complex features into the barrel because they could trust their subcontractors to build interchangeable parts-- the Sten had magazine feed problems the entire war because of contractors going off spec and the Soviets had innumerable problems with QA. If you can&#x27;t trust outside firms then you have to build everything in house)<p>This means when you shoot out the barrel in an AR, your unit&#x27;s armorer can put in a new one. If you wear out the barrel in an AK, you throw away the gun-- headspacing is a factory operation, and the Red Army isn&#x27;t going to waste time transporting trash. Official doctrine on the US M3 was to provide <i>no</i> replacement parts. The whole gun was welded and riveted together. You could clean it, but otherwise it was a disposable unit.
